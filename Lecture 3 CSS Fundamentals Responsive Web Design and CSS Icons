CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed.

CSS Syntax
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block

`h1 {font-size:32px; color:red; text-align:center;}

The selector points to the HTML element to style (h1)
The declaration block (in curly braces) contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons (;). Each declaration includes a CSS property “name” or “property” and a “value”, separated by a colon (:).
Examples

`<style>
`p {font-size:32px; color:red; text-align:center;}
`</style>

Or can also be reformatted as such for readability.

<style>
p {
		font-size: 32px;
		color: red;
		text-align: center;
}
</style>

External Style Sheet
A CSS style sheet can be stored in an external file e.g mystyle.css. The external style sheets are linked to HTML pages with <link> tags.
External file (mystyle.css)
body {background-color: orange; font-family:verdana}
h1 {color: white;}
p {font-size: 20px;}
HTML file (myhtml.html)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
<body>
<h1>My First CSS Example</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
Inline Style
The CSS style is added directly into the HTML elements.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p style="font-size:25px">This is a paragraph.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px">This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
Cascading Order
If different styles are specified for HTML elements, the styles will cascade into new styles with the following priority:
Priority 1: Inline styles 
Priority 2: External and internal style sheets
